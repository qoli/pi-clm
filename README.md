```

`pi-clm` is a [Pi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) extension 
that lets the agent manage its own context: the language model can generate functions to 
modify the context (mapped as a file), and the edited version becomes its next input. 
Check our paper [Context Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2609.37725) and [research
codebase](https://github.com/facebookresearch/context-language-models). 

## Install

```sh
pi install npm:@lolipopshock/pi-clm

# From source, or to try it for one session without installing:
pi install git:github.com/lolipopshock/pi-clm
pi -e git:github.com/lolipopshock/pi-clm
```

## Quick start

| command | what it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/clm` | open the panel: **overview** (context size over time + compaction points) <br><img src=".github/images/overview.png" alt="The overview page: context size per request, with two points where the model compacted its own context" width="720"> <br> **input** (what the next request contains) · **edits** (per-revision side-by-side diff) <br><img src=".github/images/edits.png" alt="The edits page: a tool result before and after the model shortened it" width="720">|
| `/clm status` | three lines: next request vs budget, edits, changed settings |
| `/clm config` | open **settings**; `/clm config <setting> <value>` changes one, `/clm config reset` drops this session's changes<br><img src=".github/images/settings.png" alt="The settings page: sizes, guard, files, and every setting" width="720"> |
| `/clm-compact [instructions]` | ask the model to compact its own context now; anything you add (e.g. what to keep) is passed along. The result shows on the **edits** page |
| `/clm on` / `off` / `reset` | enable, use raw context, discard the projection |

In the panel: `1–4` or `Tab` switch pages, `← →` step through compaction points, `z`
zooms the chart, `Enter` opens the selection, `q` closes.
